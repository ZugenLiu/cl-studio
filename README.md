# cl-studio
IDE for Common Lisp based on Emacs (24.x or above) and [emacs.d](http://coderwall.com/purcell).

# Prelude
This distribution contains set plugins for productive work on Common Lisp by my opinion. You can add support for the other languages yourself using standard emacs way.

# Installation

To install, clone this repo to `~/.emacs.d`, i.e. ensure that the
`init.el` contained in this repo ends up at `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

```
git clone https://github.com/avatar29A/cl-studio.git ~/.emacs.d
```

Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, further third-party
packages will be automatically downloaded and installed. If you
encounter any errors at that stage, try restarting Emacs, and possibly
running `M-x package-refresh-contents` before doing so.

# Features

in progress

## Troubles

Some Windows users might need to follow
[these instructions](http://xn--9dbdkw.se/diary/how_to_enable_GnuTLS_for_Emacs_24_on_Windows/index.en.html)
to get TLS (ie. SSL) support included in their Emacs.
